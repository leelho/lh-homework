## *2.简答题*   


## *3、解释以下词汇*  
  
### *汇编语言Assembly Language*   
>*An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.*   
### *编译（Compiler）*   
>*A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.*   
### *命令式语言（Imperative programming）*  
>*In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.*   
### *函数编程语言（Functional programming）*  
>*In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.*   
### *过程式编程（Procedural programming）*  
>*Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.*
