# <center> *第六次作业*</center>    
## *1.Program with machine language according to the following c.*
int_8 a = 1;
int_8 c = a + 3;    
## Write your assembly code & machine code   
## *2.简答题*     
### What are stored in memory?   
> *有cpu计算出来的数据存储在内存里面还有各种程序，指令。*   

### Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?    
> *不行，有专门的指令存储器*   

### Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
> *当汇编程序处理一个指令时，它将指令从其助记符形式转换为标准的机器语言格式，称为“指令格式”。在转换过程中，汇编程序必须确定指令的类型，将符号标签和显式表示法转换为基本/位移格式，确定某些操作数的长度并解析任何文字和常量.*

## *3、解释以下词汇*  
  
### *汇编语言Assembly Language*   
>*An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.*   
### *编译（Compiler）*   
>*A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.*   
### *命令式语言（Imperative programming）*  
>*In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.*   
### *函数编程语言（Functional programming）*  
>*In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.*   
### *过程式编程（Procedural programming）*  
>*Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.*
